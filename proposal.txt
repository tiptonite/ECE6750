Proposal for ECE 6750 Research Project
Nathan Tipton and Tarrin Rasmussen

Develop an application specific processor (ASP) implemented on an FPGA and optimized for techniques such as 
loop unrolling, pipelining, and paralellization.Compare performance against a general purpose processor 
on a specific application such as simulated annealing, md5, convolution, etc.  The specific general purpose processor was chosen because we already have it on hand and it is a newer processor.  This will give us a good comparison to see if our optimizations for the ASP really make a difference.  We may also test on other processors for additional comparisons.

Comparison Metric: Execution Time

General Purpose processor: Intel Core i-5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz x 4

FPGA: Basys 3 Artix-7
